# Cmd-Parrot
A cmd parrot, the password to the zip is PARROT
This file contains a .Bat, a .cmd and a .txt file, due to the fact that they are bat files and cmd files, windows defender will likely block them, dont worry, these arent a virus and you can review the code yourself.
Please remember that i made this in short ime so it isnt very polished.
